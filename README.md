Karapetyan David

The project is an application for analyzing saxophone sound and identifying notes played in an audio file or in real time. This application helps musicians and composers.

Contents

This project is a prototype of an application that analyzes saxophone sound, identifies notes and displays them as a sheet music. In the future, it is planned to improve the algorithms using machine learning technologies and add support for other musical instruments.

Functionality

Loading audio files in *wav, *mp3 format.
Recording sound by pressing the "Record" button.
Analysis of notes and their duration.
Displaying analysis results.
Exporting results in text format.
Technologies

The following technologies were used to implement the application:

PyQt6 — to create a graphical interface.
Sounddevice — to record sound in real time.
Librosa — to process and analyze audio files.
SQLite3 — for storing analysis history.
